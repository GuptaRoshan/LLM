## ⚙️ Phase 1: Foundations (2–4 weeks)

**Goal:** Understand core AI/ML concepts and LLM basics

### Topics:
- What is AI, ML, Deep Learning?
- Neural networks (basics)
- NLP fundamentals
- What are transformers and how do LLMs work?

### Resources:
- 📘 [Google’s Machine Learning Crash Course](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/crash-course)
- 📺 YouTube: "Neural Networks from Scratch" by 3Blue1Brown
- 📘 Book: “The Hundred-Page Machine Learning Book” by Andriy Burkov (skim relevant chapters)
- 📺 [Jay Alammar’s Visual Guides](https://jalammar.github.io/) – Transformers, BERT, GPT-2
- 📘 Blog: [“A Hacker’s Guide to GPT”](https://github.com/openai/gpt-2/blob/master/model_card.md)

**Milestone:**
- Be able to explain what an LLM is and how it’s different from traditional models
- Code a simple text classification model using Hugging Face or spaCy

---

## ⚙️ Phase 2: Intermediate – Hands-on with LLMs (3–6 weeks)

**Goal:** Get practical with LLMs – APIs, fine-tuning, prompt engineering

### Topics:
- Hugging Face Transformers (loading, using models)
- OpenAI API / Claude / Mistral / Gemini APIs
- Prompt Engineering (zero-shot, few-shot, chain-of-thought)
- Basic fine-tuning / adapters (LoRA)

### Resources:
- 🔧 [Hugging Face Course](https://huggingface.co/learn/nlp-course/)
- 📘 [Prompt Engineering Guide](https://github.com/dair-ai/Prompt-Engineering-Guide)
- 💻 OpenAI Cookbook: https://github.com/openai/openai-cookbook
- 🛠️ LangChain/LLamaIndex tutorials (agent frameworks)

**Milestone:**
- Build a chatbot or tool using GPT-4 / LLaMA / Mistral
- Deploy a simple LLM-powered app (e.g., resume analyzer, email generator)

---

## 🤖 Phase 3: Agentic AI – Autonomy, Planning, Tool Use (4–6 weeks)

**Goal:** Learn how to build agents that can plan, reason, and use tools

### Topics:
- What is Agentic AI? (AutoGPT, BabyAGI, ReAct, Toolformer)
- Planning + memory in agents
- Tool use and function calling
- LangChain Agents, OpenAI Functions, AutoGen, CrewAI

### Resources:
- 📘 [ReAct Paper (Reason + Act)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.03629)
- 💻 [LangChain Agent docs](https://docs.langchain.com/docs/components/agents/)
- 💻 [AutoGen by Microsoft](https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/)
- 💡 Tutorials: “Build a GPT Agent from scratch” (search on GitHub/YT)

**Milestone:**
- Build an agent that uses tools (search, calculator, file reader)
- Try building a multi-agent system (e.g., planning + execution)

---

## 🛠️ Phase 4: Capstone Projects + Exploration (ongoing)

**Goal:** Create projects, explore research, contribute to OSS

### Project Ideas:
- Personal assistant (scheduling, answering questions, web scraping)
- Autonomous research agent
- Custom RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) system
- Multi-agent debate system
- Domain-specific agent (e.g., legal, medical, code assistant)

### Advanced Readings:
- 📄 “Toolformer: Language Models Can Teach Themselves to Use Tools”
- 📄 “AutoGPT, BabyAGI, LangGraph” GitHub repos
- 🔬 Keep up with [Papers with Code](https://paperswithcode.com/), ArXiv Sanity, Twitter

---

## ✅ Tools to Master Along the Way
- Python + PyTorch / TensorFlow
- Hugging Face Transformers & Datasets
- OpenAI API / Anthropic Claude / Mistral
- LangChain, LlamaIndex, CrewAI, AutoGen
- Vector DBs: FAISS, Pinecone, Chroma
